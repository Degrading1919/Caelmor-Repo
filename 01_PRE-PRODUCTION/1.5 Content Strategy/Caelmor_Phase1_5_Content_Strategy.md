# Caelmor — Phase 1.5 Content Strategy  
### v1 Content Minimums for a Complete, Shippable Core Experience  
**Document Type:** Pre-Production Specification  
**Phase:** 1.5 — Content Strategy  
**Author:** Game Director & Producer  
**Scope:** v1 (Lowmark Vale only)

---

# 0. Purpose of This Document
Phase 1.5 establishes exact content quantities required for Caelmor v1 — enough to deliver:

- A full Lowmark Vale experience (the only region shipping in v1)  
- A complete vertical slice  
- A slow, rewarding, handcrafted progression loop  
- Systems that feel purposeful, never grind-driven  

This is not a content catalog; it defines counts, types, and purpose so downstream roles can produce consistent, feasible deliverables.

---

# 1. High-Level v1 Content Model
v1 releases with:

- **1 full region:** Lowmark Vale  
- **3–4 subzones**  
- **1 major quest arc + side quests + micro-events**  
- **Full early/mid progression: combat + gathering + crafting**  
- **Handcrafted enemy ecology**  

The world must feel atmospheric, intentional, and complete.

# 10. Content Density Rules
1. Enemies spawn in small, readable clusters  
2. Nodes must not form exploitable “resource corridors”  
3. Every POI expresses a micro-story  
4. All content must reinforce progression or atmosphere  
5. No skill or quest should require repetitive grinding of a single node  
6. Travel must feel scenic, not padded
