# Caelmor — Phase 1.1 Core Vision  
Document  
Prepared by: Game Director & Producer  
Project: Caelmor (Mythic Medieval Online RPG)

## 1. Core Experience Vision

Caelmor delivers a slow-paced, atmospheric, discovery-driven RPG experience.  
The player explores a grounded, mythic-medieval world that feels ancient, weathered,  
and meaningfully alive. Progression is slow but never padded, always rewarding the player  
with novelty, deeper mastery, and emotional connection to the world.

---

## 2. Target Player Profile

Caelmor is designed primarily for players motivated by Discovery, Mastery, Efficiency,  
and Social connection—placing strong emphasis on Discovery and Mastery. These players value:

• Immersive worlds with environmental storytelling  
• Systems that reward deep understanding rather than reflexes  
• Meaningful progression without chore-like grinds  

---

## 3. Emotional Tone & Atmosphere

The emotional tone is quiet, mythic, and contemplative. The world feels old but alive,  
revealing its stories through ruins, culture, and subtle details. The tone avoids high-fantasy spectacle  
in favor of weathered beauty and a sense of place shaped by forgotten histories.

---

## 4. Distinctiveness of Caelmor

Caelmor differentiates itself through three pillars:  
A. Slow Progression Without Pain  
B. A World That Feels Truly Alive  
C. Grounded, Transparent Combat Based on Timing & Spacing

These pillars focus on removing unintentional friction while preserving challenge,  
mystery, and meaningful decisions.

## 5. Progression Philosophy

**“Slow but rewarding, never slow and empty.”**

Progression emphasizes:  
• New discoveries tied to world geography  
• Useful crafting and items (no junk leveling)  
• Tiered gear progression that feels handcrafted  
• Exploration that avoids repetitive backtracking or filler  

---

## 6. Player Journey Feel

The player begins as an ordinary wanderer and grows into a skilled explorer, survivor, or artisan.  
Core emotional beats include: **Wonder → Competence → Attachment → Agency → Mastery.**

---

## 7. Non■Negotiables

• No filler fetch quests  
• Crafting-from-storage and low-friction inventory  
• Fair, readable enemy telegraphs  
• No bullet-sponge enemies unless justified  
• No overly punishing death penalties  
• Co-op progress is shared, never host-only  
• Instanced or fair loot rules  
• UI that stays out of the player’s way  

---

## 8. Scope Constraints for v1

• No ranged combat or spell systems  
• No mount systems  
• No factions reputation system  
• No large-scale PvP  
• No procedural generation  
• No cinematic cutscenes  
• Limited weapon categories, but deeply tuned  
• 3–4 handcrafted zones focused on depth, not size  

---

## 9. Combat Vision (Final)

Caelmor uses a hybrid melee system where the server resolves combat through steady ticks  
for consistency and fairness, while players experience cooldown-based attacks shaped by  
weapon rhythm and timing. This creates slow, grounded medieval combat based on spacing,  
commitment, and clear telegraphs—without dodge-rolls, reflex-heavy mechanics, or modern  
“tactical shooter” implications.

---

## 10. One-Sentence Vision Statement

**“Caelmor is a slow, atmospheric, mythic■medieval RPG focused on meaningful discovery, grounded  
melee combat, and progression that respects the player’s time within a world that feels truly alive.”**
