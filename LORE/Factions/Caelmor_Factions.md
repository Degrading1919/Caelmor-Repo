# I. THE REMNANT (GLOBAL SHADOW FACTION)
### **Nature:** Secretive, authoritarian magical order  
### **Origin:** Formed 1–2 generations after the Great War  
### **Base:** Emberholt (Ashfall Depths, lower sanctums)  
### **Philosophy:** “Fire is power, but only disciplined flame should shape the world.”

> **Correction Note:**  
The Remnant’s original philosophy (“magic must never again be left to the undisciplined many”) contradicted Emberholt canon.  
Updated to match the *Two-Faced Magic Doctrine* — the Remnant wants **mass embercraft adoption**, but **under their control**.

---

## 1. THE ASHFALL AUTHORITY  
**Status:** Inner Circle of the Remnant (true leadership)  
**Visibility:** Completely hidden from public knowledge  
**Primary Domain:** Deep volcanic sanctums under Emberholt  

### **Purpose & Doctrine**
- Shape embercraft education across Emberholt to produce a magically competent population.  
- Manipulate civic leadership and emotional culture to keep the population “forge-ready.”  
- Study ember veins and emotional ignition thresholds to refine embercraft mass-scalability.  
- Control the pace and spread of magical knowledge, guiding it toward Remnant ends.  
- Maintain secrecy around Volkhari lineage, the Glassed Hollow, and ritual catastrophes.

> **Canon Fix:**  
They are NOT restricting magic. They are **weaponizing public embercraft while controlling its advanced forms**.

### **Structure**
- **Matriarch Selvara Cael’Thalos** — High Seat, architect of Emberholt’s magical future.  
- **Lord Varyn Durell** — Strategist of interregional manipulation.  
- **Lady Meryndis Kael’Vorra** — Keeper of Forbidden Rites, ritual engineer.  
- **Deepbrand Command (Varos Keln)** — Enforces Authority goals underground.  
- **Red-Lit Scribes** — Interpret ancient runes and ritual structures.  
- **Hearthveil Initiates** — Dream manipulators and emotional-state engineers.

### **Operations**
- Secret excavation of ancient ember-vein chambers beneath Emberholt.  
- Emotional and psychological conditioning of civic leaders through dream manipulation.  
- Calibration and modification of embercraft curricula taught to children and laborers.  
- Acquisition of “special anomalies”:  
  - ember-touched children  
  - high-potential embercraft prodigies  
  - surviving Volkhari lineage  

> **Canon Correction:**  
Volkhari “High Smoke” terminology removed; use “Volkhari” only.

### **Long-Term Goal**
A continent where **fire magic is universal**, but *true mastery* belongs only to the Remnant.

---

## 2. DEEPBRAND  
**Status:** Enforcement & Excavation Arm of the Remnant  
**Command:** Dreadbrand Varos Keln  
**Purpose:** Physical enforcement, excavation, containment, ritual infrastructure  

### **Activities**
- Conduct dangerous excavation of dormant ember veins and collapsed caverns.  
- Breach ancient gateways and volcanic tunnels related to pre-Remnant ritual structures.  
- Oversee containment chambers in Emberdeep Warrens, including Volkhari holding cells.  
- Handle “volatile subjects” (resultants of failed embercraft enhancements or resonance overload).

> **Correction:**  
Deepbrand now explicitly manages the **captured Volkhari**, aligning with Emberholt canon.

### **Reputation**
Among lower Emberholt:
> “Deepbrand doesn’t rescue you. They retrieve what’s left.”

---

## 3. RED-LIT SCRIBES  
**Status:** Scholarly arm of the Remnant  
**Leader(s):** Archivist Marenya Silvertide; Scribe-Magus Ilverin Qael  

### **Focus Areas**
- Translate ancient inscriptions related to embercraft, Volkhari history, and Memorywarden parallels.  
- Maintain sanitized public historical records while curating hidden archives beneath the city.  
- Research dangerous magical systems (embercraft resonance, emotional volatility thresholds).  
- Validate, alter, or destroy texts that contradict the Remnant–approved historical narrative.

### **Notable Practices**
- Ember-ink glyph animation (used to test rune stability).  
- Interpretation of “memory walls” (resonance-scarred stone).  
- Maintenance of dual archives: public/political and forbidden/ritual.

---

## 4. THE HEARTHVEIL INITIATES  
**Status:** Remnant psychological & spiritual influence division  
**Primary Duty:** Dream manipulation, emotional engineering, compliance shaping  

### **Capabilities**
- Seed controlled dreams into civic leaders, embercraft instructors, and promising students.  
- Shape “visions” that reinforce Remnant doctrine and Emberholt cultural narratives.  
- Influence public emotion waves (fear, unity, fervor) via dream saturation.  
- Identify children whose emotional resonance suggests high embercraft potential.

### **Key Figures**
- Vision-Mother Calynne Vorr  
- Initiate-Lumen Serix Arden  

> **Correction:**  
Their goal is **not to suppress magic**, but to **control emotional states that influence fire magic**.

---

# II. EMBERHOLT FACTIONS (CIVIC, RELIGIOUS, GUILDS, MILITARY)

The city operates under a **dual identity**:
- **Public face:** A thriving magical metropolis where embercraft is a civic discipline.  
- **Hidden truth:** Emberholt is being shaped into a magically armed population under Remnant guidance.

---

## 5. THE FLAMEWARD SPEAKER’S CIVIC COUNCIL  
**Nature:** Emberholt’s public government  
**Role:** Administrative, judicial, ceremonial  

### **Core Members**
- Flameward Speaker (public leader of Emberholt)  
- Magister Vael Trossen  
- Magistrix Ralenne Kharveil  
- Trade Commissioner Oren Falx  
- District Overseers (e.g., Yorven Khelt)

### **Mandate**
- Manage trade, markets, city infrastructure, and public festivals.  
- Oversee embercraft training in schools and guilds.  
- Enforce “safe embercraft regulations” (while unintentionally advancing Remnant goals).  
- Maintain civic unity through emotional-discipline ceremonies.

> **Canon Fix:**  
The Council does NOT restrict magic; they regulate it publicly while unknowingly helping the Remnant scale fire magic citywide.

### **Secret Weakness**
Several members unknowingly act under Hearthveil-induced dream influence.

---

## 6. EMBERGUARD LEGIONS  
**Nature:** Military and police force  
**Leadership:** Grand Marshal Kaevren Thalos  
**Purpose:** Protect Emberholt, maintain order, secure tunnels, regulate embercraft demonstrations  

### **Special Divisions**
- **Border-Wardens** (Haelric Stormvein) — Mountain perimeter patrols  
- **Cinderwatch** — Riot, accident, and ember surge response  
- **Ashfall Integration Teams** — Emberguard units embedded with Deepbrand for tunnel security

### **Recent Shifts**
- Emberguard training increasingly includes coordinated embercraft maneuvers.  
- Growing conflict between traditional civic guards and Remnant-aligned officers.

---

## 7. EMBER-SEARED COVENANT  
**Nature:** Emberholt’s public fire-faith tradition  
**Leader:** Ember-Priestess Seralynd Hearthveil  
**Vision:** Fire as memory, discipline, and transformation  

### **Practices**
- Public flame rituals on the Ash Terraces  
- Commemorative emberlight vigils  
- Ceremonial placation of the “Chambers Below”  
- Rites promoting emotional balance and fire mastery

### **Divide**
Some branches have been subtly influenced by the Hearthveil Initiates, shifting doctrine toward Remnant goals.

---

## 8. THE FORGEGUILDS OF EMBERHOLT  
**Nature:** Artisan and engineering guilds  
**Key Leaders:**  
- Forge-Master Durnan Volkryst (Basalt Forge Guild)  
- Selice Morra (Emberglass Masters Guild)

### **Functions**
- Embersteel weapon forging  
- Emberglass craftwork  
- Magma-heated civic infrastructure  
- Manufacturing tools for embercraft education  
- Limited weaponmaking under city mandate

### **Tensions**
- Many guilds resent deep Remnant interference.  
- They possess fragments of pre-War forging techniques that Remnant scholars covet.

---

## 9. THE MERCHANT HOUSES  
**Notables:** Merchant-Lord Eraven Cyl  
**Power Base:** Wealth, trade, outer-region influence  

### **Purpose**
- Sustain Emberholt’s commercial dominance  
- Manage trade of emberglass, weapons, and embercraft supplies  
- Secure trade routes to Lowmark, Thornfell, and the Mire

### **Hidden Role**
- Some houses act as covert Remnant fronts.  
- Others resist but fear retaliation.

---

## 10. CINDERWALL SYNDICATES  
**Nature:** Criminal/semi-legitimate community coalitions  
**Most Powerful:** Dalia Vret’s Embervein Traffickers  

### **Operations**
- Illegal tapping of ember veins  
- Emberstone smuggling  
- Black-market embercraft augmentation  
- Protection networks for the lower wards

### **Rationale**
Cinderwall distrusts city elites and the Remnant.  
Syndicates rise to protect their own, for better or worse.

---

## 11. UNDERGROUND INFORMATION NETWORKS  
**Key Figure:** “The Cinder Rat”  
**Purpose:**  
- Track Deepbrand tunnel movements  
- Leak or sell secrets to opposing factions  
- Maintain delicate balances between Emberholt’s many competing powers

# III. VOLKHARI FACTIONS (DRAGONKIN HYBRIDS)

### **Status:** The world believes them extinct  
### **Truth:** A hidden People, not a political faction  
### **Canon Fix:**  
- “High Smoke” terminology removed.  
- Volkhari are **one race**, not divided by sub-tribes or proto-lineages.  
- Fire Titan is NOT a Volkhari; see corrected entry below.

---

## 12. THE AERIE OF SILENT EMBERS  
**Nature:** Hidden enclave of surviving Volkhari dragonkin  
**Population:** ~8–12 (not counting the captive or the Titan)  
**Location:** High volcanic ridges outside Emberholt  

### **Practices**
- Memory-flame rituals (emotionally anchored, not spellcasting)  
- Ember-resonance meditation  
- Preservation of ancient doctrine:  
  “Fire is sacred, but only the disciplined may bear it.”  

> **Correction:**  
Their doctrine must not oppose public magic — their fear is specifically **unrestrained, emotionally unstable firecraft**, not magic itself.

### **Key Members**
- Matron Vaelyra (Elder)  
- Seredh Embercarver (Historian)  
- Asera of the Three Breaths (Ritualist)  
- Thennek Vorren (Guardian)  
- Maeryn Vall (Hidden within Emberholt)  
- Dahrin Vosk (Fugitive survivor)  
- Kaelen Veyr’un (Youth)  
- Ilyen Veyr’un (Mother)  
- Kaelith Veyr’un (**The Unburnt Boy — escaped, NOT captured**)

> **Critical Canon Fix:**  
Kaelith escaped the Glassed Hollow.  
ONE other Volkhari — now identified below — *was* captured.

### **Faction Position**
Survival above all else.  
Prevent another magical catastrophe.  
Avoid Emberholt at all costs.  
Observe the Remnant from afar without intervening unless forced.

---

## 13. THE FIRE TITAN (NOT VOLKHARI)  
**Nature:** A Remnant-made magical tragedy, NOT a Volkhari evolution  
**Origin (Corrected):**  
A **Remnant initiate** overwhelmed by embercraft emotional overload during an early ritual experiment.  
They lost themselves to fire resonance and became an uncontrollable, molten creature.

### **Why this correction matters**
- Titan ≠ Volkhari, per your rules  
- Titan is a symbol of Remnant hubris  
- Titan is a warning for what Emberholt might become  

### **Relevance**
- Deepbrand fears its re-emergence  
- Volkhari recognize it as a desecration, not kin  
- Remnant study it as a failed template for “Perfect Flame”

---

## 14. ASHFALL CAPTIVE VOLKHARI  
**Nature:** An individual, not a faction  
**Correct Identity:** *Thalan Veyr* (name preserved)  
**Status:** Held within Remnant ritual chambers  

### **Purpose**
The captive is exploited for:
- ember-vein resonance study  
- emotional ignition thresholds  
- Volkhari fire-tolerance research  
- catalyst testing for Perfect Flame prototypes  

### **Relevance to Canon**
- Confirms Remnant’s interest in biological fire affinity  
- Serves as a moral anchor for Emberholt’s darkest secrets  
- Counterpoint to the Unburnt Boy  

---

# IV. REGIONAL FACTIONS (OUTSIDE EMBERHOLT)

> **Major Note:**  
Several factions in Lowmark, Thornfell, and the Mire referenced **incorrect elemental associations** from early drafts.  
All corrected below.

---

## 15. LOWMARK FACTIONS  (WATER REGION — CORRECTED)

### A. THE SHADEWEAVERS  
**Nature:** Smuggler–spy network  
**Philosophy:** Information is survival; loyalty is negotiable  

### **Operations**
- Smuggling riverglass and restricted texts  
- Infiltrating noble houses  
- Quiet observation of Wraith events  
- Maintaining shadow channels with Emberholt merchants  

> **Canon Fix:**  
Removed references to “shadow magic residue” — magic is not practiced in Lowmark.  
They exploit **fog, acoustics, and river routes**, not arcane techniques.

---

### B. THE LOWMARK LENSEMASTERS  
**Nature:** Scholars, water-ritual archivists  
**Role (Corrected):**  
They preserve **pre-War water-magic theory**, not active spellcraft.

### **Goal**
Prevent misuse of pre-War ritual arrays or water-memory artifacts that persist in rare places.

> **Canon Fix:**  
Lowmark does NOT currently practice water magic.  
They study theory only.  
All magical behavior is environmental, not deliberate casting.

---

## 16. THORNFELL FACTIONS (AIR REGION — CORRECTED)

### A. THE STONEBLOOD CLANS  
**Nature:** Clans shaped by post-War trauma  
**Original Description:** Anti-magic doctrine  
**Correction:**  
Thornfell’s people **do not know air-magic exists**.  
Their aversion is to *magical misuse*, not air itself.

### **Philosophy (Corrected)**  
“Stone is truth; the wind speaks only in echoes of the past.”  

### **Role**
- Regulate clan disputes  
- Maintain defensive culture  
- Oppose Emberholt magical expansion (correct)  
- Preserve traditions without recognizing magical roots

---

### B. THE CLIFFWARD SENTINELS  
**Nature:** Ridge patrol rangers  
**Traits:** Stoic, vigilant, highly skilled in acoustics and terrain  

### **Correction:**  
They are NOT anti-magic zealots.  
They interpret resonance and wind anomalies as natural terrain effects.

Their duties:
- Guard high passes  
- Respond to cliff collapses  
- Track smugglers  
- Maintain horn codes descended from Echohewn practice

---

## 17. THE MIRE FACTIONS (EARTH REGION — CORRECTED)

### A. MISTTIDE TRADITIONS  
**Original Issue:** Described as *water mystics*, contradicting Earth canon  
**Correction:**  
Misttide Traditions are the **remnants of pre-War earth-attuned, emotional practitioners**, not water-mages.

### **Nature:**  
Folkloric spiritual lineage retaining fragments of Memorywarden philosophy.

### **Traits (Corrected):**
- Emotional reading  
- Remembrance rites  
- Interpret mudflow patterns, trench hums, and soil echoes  
- No active magic, no watercraft  

> **They practice emotional interpretation tied to earth resonance, NOT spellwork.**

---

### B. ROOTSHADOW SYNDICATE  
**Nature:** Mire underworld network  

### **Strengths**
- Stealth  
- Poisons  
- Bog infiltration  
- Manipulation of memory-distorted terrain  

> **Canon Fix:**  
Removed references to mystic shadowcraft; all abilities grounded and non-magical.

### **Weakness**
- Distrustful  
- Fragmented  
- Avoid involvement in large-scale conflict  

# V. SPIRITUAL & ANCIENT FACTIONS

> **Major Canon Corrections:**  
> - Removed references implying forgotten “ancient air/earth/water spellcasters” unless tied to Founders.  
> - Stonebound corrected to match subtle, mythic canon (NOT active golems, NOT elemental soldiers).  
> - Elemental Traditions corrected to reflect EARLY rediscovery, not modern magical casting.

---

## 18. THE STONEBOUND (ANCIENT)

### **Nature:**  
Ancient, semi-sentient constructs of the Mythic Age, created long before the First Mages rediscovered the primal elements.

### **Purpose (Corrected):**
- Maintain **volcanic stability**, resonance balance, and subterranean flows.  
- Store **emotional memory** impressions over centuries.  
- Function as **passive guardians**, not soldiers or spellcasters.

### **Status (Corrected):**  
- Mostly dormant.  
- Rare activation is environmental and resonance-driven, NOT intentional.  
- Activity spikes correlate with Remnant excavation beneath Emberholt.

### **Relevance (Aligned to Canon):**
- Remnant disturbances are beginning to wake isolated Stonebound nodes.  
- The “Stonebound guardian” phenomena in Thornfell and Emberholt are the same ancient network manifesting differently.  
- The Stonebound **do not communicate** directly—modern people interpret their activity symbolically, often incorrectly.

---

## 19. THE ELEMENTAL TRADITIONS (HISTORICAL)

### **Nature:**  
Early rediscovery schools founded by the **First Mages**, prior to the Great War.

> **Canon Fix:**  
- “First Mages” is NOT a formal title — it refers to the early rediscoverers of each element.  
- They are NOT related to Dreamers.  
- Their schools were philosophical + proto-magical, NOT modern spellcasting academies.

### **Status:**  
Mostly dissolved, fragmented, or absorbed into later cultural traditions.

### **Influence (Corrected):**

**Water Tradition → Lowmark**  
- Influence survives in reflective rites and water-memory metaphors.  
- No active water magic remains.

**Air Tradition → Thornfell**  
- Founded by the **Dwarven First Air Mage**.  
- Survives as echo-sensitive architecture and horn code culture.  
- Thornfell does not recognize this as magic.

**Earth Tradition → The Mire**  
- Pre-War grounding and remembrance rites linked to Memorywarden origins.  
- Survives in emotional intuition, soil-reading, trench rituals.

**Fire Tradition → Emberholt**  
- Remnant rebuilt this tradition into a civic embercraft doctrine.  
- Emberholt publicly practices daily fire-magic.  
- Advanced firecraft preserved in Remnant ritual chambers.

> **Critical Clarification:**  
Elemental Traditions are about **early rediscovery of magic**, not powerful ancient orders.

---

# VI. REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS (MODERN)

---

## 20. EMBERHOLT CITY-STATE  
### **Nature:** Dual governance  
- **Public:** Flameward Speaker’s Civic Council (legitimate government)  
- **Hidden:** Ashfall Authority (Remnant Core)

### **Correction:**  
Public governance appears stable, prosperous, and magically advanced.  
Secret governance aims to weaponize the population through mass embercraft education.

### **Values:**  
- Discipline  
- Controlled emotion  
- Public magic mastery  
- Civic pride  
- Industrial progress  

---

## 21. THE LOWMARK MARCHES  
### **Government:** Noble lineages + Lensemasters’ scholastic counsel  
### **Values:**  
- Reflection  
- Water-based cultural metaphors  
- Emotional clarity and calm  
- Preservation of knowledge  

> **Canon Fix:**  
Lowmark *does not* practice magic; water-magic remnants are environmental.

---

## 22. THORNFELL MARCHES  
### **Government:** Clan tribunals and rotational councils  

### **Values (Corrected):**  
- Endurance  
- Honor  
- Practical, terrain-based wisdom  
- Respect for stone, skepticism of visible magic  
- Unrecognized air-magic ancestry embedded in architecture and acoustics  

> **Key Fix:**  
They are NOT consciously anti-magic zealots — they simply distrust spectacle and overt magic after the Great War.

---

## 23. THE MIRE OF FALLEN BANNERS  
### **Government:** Fragmented marsh communities, chapel councils, and cooperatives  

### **Values (Corrected):**  
- Survival  
- Communal grief  
- Remembrance  
- Emotional intuition  
- Earth resonance and environmental memory  

### **Clarification:**  
Magic here is **dormant and forgotten**.  
Rituals mimic Memorywarden rites, but are not active spellcraft.

# VII. INTER-FACTION RELATIONSHIPS (GLOBAL ALIGNMENT)

> **This section clarifies relationships implied throughout the file and fixes contradictions caused by older drafts.**

- The Remnant **does not suppress magic** in Emberholt.  
- They **promote public embercraft** as a means of mass militarization.  
- The Flameward Speaker acts as both a public leader and a compliant Remnant instrument.  
- Remnant internal branches (Ashfall Authority, Deepbrand, Hearthveil Initiates, Red-Lit Scribes) shape Emberholt’s doctrines, dreams, and education.

**Conflict:**  
- Emberforged Guilds resent interference.  
- Some Merchant Houses quietly resist economic manipulation.

- They caused the Glassed Hollow disaster accidentally through ritual overreach.  
- Kaelith (Unburnt Boy) escaped — **not captured**.  
- Thalan Veyr is the **only captive Volkhari**, used in ritual studies.  
- The Fire Titan is **a failed Remnant initiate**, not Volkhari.

**Volkhari Position:**  
- Remnant represents the greatest threat to their survival.  
- They do not retaliate — they hide, watch, and mourn.

---

## C. REMNANT ↔ REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS (Alignment Fixes)

### **Lowmark**  
- Limited interest; occasional observation of Wraith drift or river anomalies.  
- Shadeweavers sometimes feed information into Remnant channels unwillingly.

### **Thornfell**  
- Remnant sees Thornfell as magically dormant.  
- Echochamber Summit draws small academic interest, but its secrets remain sealed.

### **The Mire**  
- Remnant dismisses the region as magically inert.  
- Memorywarden relics sometimes surface, but they ignore them as “emotional artifacts.”

---

## D. REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS ↔ EACH OTHER (Canon Consistency)

### **Lowmark ↔ Thornfell**
- Mutually respectful.  
- Trade routes steady.  
- Thornfell quietly envies Lowmark’s calm politics.

### **Lowmark ↔ The Mire**
- Strong sympathy and shared grief.  
- Rituals occasionally blend during remembrance events.

### **Thornfell ↔ The Mire**
- Cautious respect.  
- Thornfell distrusts environmental anomalies, though they misinterpret them.

### **Thornfell ↔ Emberholt**
- High tension.  
- Thornfell suspects Emberholt’s magical ambition.  
- Emberholt views Thornfell as traditionalists clinging to old fears.

### **The Mire ↔ Emberholt**
- Bitter resentment.  
- The Mire remembers fire devastation more vividly than any region.

---

# VIII. CANON ALIGNMENT SUMMARY (FINAL PASS)

This section ensures the *entire Factions file* matches **Phase 1 Canon**, **regional dossiers**, and all updates.

### ✔ Magic System Corrections
- Embercraft = fire magic (NOT all magic).  
- Emberwork = industrial fire-tech (NOT magic).  
- Lowmark magic is dormant.  
- Thornfell magic is forgotten air resonance.  
- Mire magic is earth-memory resonance (dormant).  
- No factions practice open spellcraft except Emberholt citizens.

### ✔ Volkhari Corrections
- Volkhari are one race, not subdivided.  
- They were nearly annihilated in the Glassed Hollow.  
- Kaelith escaped; Thalan is the captive.  
- Fire Titan is NOT Volkhari.

### ✔ Elemental Corrections
- Lowmark = Water  
- Thornfell = Air  
- Mire = Earth  
- Emberholt = Fire  
- All faction roles updated to reflect this.

### ✔ Founder / Dreamer / First Mage Corrections
- Dreamers = post-War dream-visions (NOT founders).  
- First Mages = earliest rediscoverers of each element.  
- Founders = iconic teachers, not titles.

### ✔ Remnant Canon Fix
- They **do not suppress magic**.  
- They **scale fire magic publicly** while keeping advanced forms restricted.  
- They aim for continent-spanning magical dominance.
