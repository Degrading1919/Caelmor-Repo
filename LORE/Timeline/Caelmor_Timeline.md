# I. THE MYTHIC AGE (PREHISTORY → ~3,000+ YEARS AGO)

### • The Forgotten God Walks the Living World
- The world is young, quiet, and spiritually awake.  
- Humans and early peoples experience direct communion with the divine.  
- Magic does not exist as a system—only *divine interaction* and *living intuition*.

### • The Stonebound Are Forged
- Stonebound constructs—sentient mechanisms of stone and ember—are shaped by divine command.  
- Their purpose:  
  • maintain volcanic harmony  
  • regulate ember-veins  
  • preserve ancient memory  
- They do **not** teach magic; they maintain *balance*.  
- They build deep structures beneath what will one day become Emberholt.

### • The Volkhari Appear (Dragonkin Hybrids)
- A fire-attuned people arise near the first volcanic ridges.  
- Not beasts, not dragons—*a distinct people* carrying innate ember resonance.  
- Fire affinity is biological, emotional, and spiritual—not learned.  
- Longevity and discipline become their hallmarks.  
- They guard volcanic sites and ember-veins for centuries.

### • Divine Connection Is Strong
- Humanity lives in spiritual alignment.  
- No magic, no rituals, no runes—only instinctive communion.

---

# II. THE AGE OF QUIET WITHDRAWAL (~3,000 → ~500 YEARS AGO)

### • Humanity Grows in Desire and Forgetfulness
- Populations expand.  
- Mortal ambition overshadows reverence.  
- The Forgotten God withdraws gradually—not in wrath, but sorrow.  
- Divine communication fades into silence.

### • A Spiritual Vacuum
- Humanity senses *absence*, not loss.  
- Intuition dulls into superstition.  
- The Volkhari continue their traditions in isolation, maintaining ember discipline.  
- The Stonebound go dormant in sealed depths.

### • The Precursor to Magic
- People begin to notice patterns:
  • heat and emotion  
  • breath and pressure  
  • stone and memory  
  • water and stillness  
- These observations remain cultural, not magical.

---

# III. THE AGE OF REDISCOVERY (~250 YEARS AGO)
*(~50–100 years before the Great War)*

### • The Dreamers Arise
Across Caelmor, rare individuals begin receiving:
- visions  
- dreams  
- ancestral echoes  
- impressions of the world-before-withdrawal  

These are **not divine commands**, but *residual spiritual memory*.

### • Regional Magical Traditions Emerge
Each region rediscovers magic independently, shaped by land and culture:
- **Emberholt:** Fire — embercraft tied to emotion and discipline  
- **Lowmark:** Water — calm, clarity, memory, and flow (Riverwarden legacy)  
- **Thornfell:** Air — resonance, echo, pressure, and sound (Echohewn legacy, unrecognized as magic)  
- **The Mire:** Earth — memory, grief, endurance, and burden (Memorywarden legacy)

Magic is a **listening discipline**, not a weapon.

### • Magic Spreads Quietly (3–4 Generations)
- Minor rituals  
- Environmental harmonies  
- Healing and stabilization practices  
- No standing armies, no mass destruction

### • Diverging Philosophies
Interpretations fracture:
- Emberholt embraces mastery and progress  
- Lowmark emphasizes restraint and balance  
- Thornfell folds strange effects into tradition  
- The Mire treats magic as remembrance, not power  

The seeds of future conflict are sown.

# IV. THE AGE OF ARROGANCE (~200 → ~160 YEARS AGO)

### • Nations Grow Competitive
Magic becomes a tool of:
- prestige  
- industrial efficiency  
- political leverage  

### • Early Weaponization
- **Emberholt** pioneers embercraft forging and amplification.  
- **Thornfell** unknowingly weaponizes air-resonance through horns, echoes, and pressure effects.  
- **The Mire** bends earth-memory to stabilize trenches and bear grief—until strain corrupts it.  
- **Lowmark refuses large-scale magic**, insisting its duty is to feed, not to devastate.

### • Volkhari Warnings
- Volkhari elders sense ember imbalance.  
- They warn Emberholt:
  > “Fire must be disciplined, or it will remember wrongly.”

They are ignored.

### • First Embercraft Disaster
- A volcanic chapel near Emberholt collapses due to emotional overload.  
- Dozens die.  
- Emberholt conceals the cause.

### • Volkhari Begin to Withdraw
- Early enclaves retreat into secrecy.  
- The foundations of the **Aerie of Silent Embers** are laid.

# V. THE GREAT WAR (~160 → ~150 YEARS AGO)

**Duration:** ~5–10 years  
**Outcome:** Catastrophic magical escalation.

### • Spark of War
- A border dispute, inflamed by magical pride, ignites open conflict.

### • Rapid Escalation
- Emberholt industrializes fire magic.  
- Thornfell’s resonance effects collapse passes and shatter formations.  
- The Mire becomes the central battlefield, absorbing grief into soil and peat.  
- Lowmark serves as Caelmor’s breadbasket, supply artery, and moral holdout.

### • The Glassed Hollow Catastrophe
- A Remnant-backed ritual attempts to push embercraft beyond human limits.  
- Emotional overload triggers a massive ember surge.  
- A **Remnant initiate**, not a Volkhari, is transformed into the **Fire Titan**.  
- Volkhari captives and ritual chambers are annihilated.  
- One Volkhari child escapes — **Kaelith Veyr’un, the Unburnt Boy**.  
- One Volkhari survivor is captured in the aftermath — **Thalan Veyr**.  
- The event is erased from public record and renamed a “forge collapse.”

### • The Volkhari Purge
- Emberholt hunts remaining Volkhari to:
  • remove witnesses  
  • study fire affinity  
  • consolidate embercraft dominance  

The world believes the Volkhari extinct.

### • The War Ends in Horror
- Embercraft detonations tear through Emberholt’s lower districts.  
- Magical fallout poisons land and memory.  
- No side claims victory.  
- The war simply stops.
