## I. REGIONAL AUTHORITY (UNITY ANCHOR)

### **Hadrik Stonewake**
**Role:** Stonewake Speaker of the Thornfell Assembly  
**Location:** Stonewake Hall (ancient echo-carved chamber)

**Overview:**  
Hadrik Stonewake is not a ruler. He is a *buffer*. Chosen by the clans for his steadiness rather than ambition, he presides over the Assembly with the understanding that his job is not to decide — but to keep Thornfell from tearing itself apart while it decides.

**Personality:**
- Calm, deeply patient
- Carries scars from the War he never speaks of
- Lets arguments burn themselves out

**Implied Depth:**
- Knows the Assembly hall amplifies certain voices unnaturally
- Chooses where people stand during debates
- Never asks why some words carry farther than others

**Canon Notes:**
- Authority is cultural, not absolute
- Represents unity under strain, not dominance

**Gameplay Hooks:**
- Assembly disputes
- Mediation quests
- Consequences based on *who* the player sides with, not outcomes alone

## III. DWARVEN ANCHOR — THE THRESHOLD CHARACTER

### **Kaldren Deepdelver**
**Role:** Dwarven Stone-Speaker; Echohewn Keeper  
**Status:** Integrated clan elder, respected Assembly voice

**Overview:**  
Kaldren is a dwarf of the old stock — not a ruler, not a scholar, but a *listener*. His people have lived alongside Thornfell’s stone longer than the clans remember. He understands systems, alignments, and stresses — not origins.

**Personality:**
- Blunt
- Dryly amused
- Deeply cautious

**Canon Boundaries (Critical):**
- Does NOT explain what the Echohewn are
- Does NOT name them as a “race” or origin

**Key Line (V1 Tone):**
> “They’re asleep.  
> And waking them all at once would tear the mountain apart.”

**Gameplay Function:**
- Helps the player align, repair, and stabilize Echohewn systems
- Explicitly limits how far reactivation can go in V1
- Serves as the gatekeeper for future awakening arcs

## IV. MILITARY & WATCH ANCHORS

### **Ressa Highcrag**
**Role:** High Ridge Warden

Ressa oversees the high passes, patrols, and horn lines. She has no patience for politics and absolute loyalty from every clan.

- Pass security
- Horn-signal quests
- Moral friction between readiness and restraint

---

---

## VI. QUIET ANOMALY WITNESS (QUEST LEAD)

### **Iven Ridgeborne**
**Role:** High-path ridge scout

**Overview:**  
Iven patrols alone, far above the passes. He notices things others don’t because he is often the only one there.

**Experiences:**
- Echoes that arrive before sound
- Wind carrying voices uphill
- Stone faces humming during storms

**Behavior:**
- Does not think this is magic
- Believes the mountains are tired
- Leads the player, step by step, to the Echohewn resting place

**Gameplay Function:**
- Primary breadcrumb trail to dormant Echohewn
- Environmental discovery without exposition
- Player arrives at truth without understanding it yet

## DESIGN SUMMARY

- **Tone:** United, proud, argumentative, loyal
- **Conflict:** Internal, cultural, unresolved
- **Echohewn:** Dormant systems, maintainable, partially re-alignable
- **Dwarves:** Living custodians, not historians
- **V1 Rule:** No full awakening, no full explanation

Thornfell does not ask what the mountain is.  
It asks whether it will still stand tomorrow.
