## I. REGIONAL AUTHORITY

### **Steward Aldric Fenmere**
**Role:** Acting Steward of Lowmark Vale; scion of House Fenmere  
**Location:** Crestbridge Hall / grain ledgers / toll offices  

**Overview:**  
Aldric Fenmere governs Lowmark not as a lord who commands, but as a steward who *administers*. House Fenmere owns much of the grain land, the largest mills, and the oldest river charters. Through inheritance rather than decree, Aldric became the quiet axis around which Lowmark turns.

**Public Perception:**  
- Polite, reserved, impeccably fair  
- Rarely raises his voice  
- Treats decisions as matters of necessity, not power  

**Private Weight:**  
- House Fenmere signed multiple wartime supply compacts  
- Aldric personally approved river movements that fed armies on all sides  
- Keeps ledgers older than the war — and refuses to destroy them  

**Canon Notes:**  
- Not a king, duke, or grand lord  
- Power derives from land, mills, and logistics  
- Embodies Lowmark’s “quietly ashamed” posture  

**Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Trade permissions  
- Tariff disputes  
- Old supply records that do not align with official war narratives

### **Corvin Tath**

### **Lessa Mirepath**
**Role:** Fen-edge guide and marsh-road pathfinder

### **Annelise Reed**

## IV. QUIET ANOMALY WITNESS

### **Tovin Pell**
**Role:** Dock laborer and mill runner  
**Location:** Brookhollow / Crestbridge  

**Overview:**  
Tovin works repetitive, physical jobs — hauling sacks, turning wheels, loading barges. He is not educated, magical, or important.

He notices patterns.

**Experiences:**  
- Reflections that lag behind movement  
- Tools found where he didn’t leave them  
- Sounds of water when no current flows  

**Behavior:**  
- Assumes something is wrong with him  
- Has started sketching river bends and mill floors  
- Never talks about it unless asked directly  

**Canon Rule:**  
Tovin does not understand what he’s witnessing.  
He does not name it.  
He does not seek answers.

**Gameplay Hooks:**  
- First anomaly breadcrumb  
- Player trust-building  
- Early proof that the world remembers

## V. RUMORED FIGURE (UNCONFIRMED)

### **“The Riverwarden”**
**Status:** Whispered, not seen  

- Spoken of in taverns and by children  
- Described inconsistently  
- Never confirmed  

This is not a character yet — only a pressure point.

---

### DESIGN SUMMARY
- **Tone:** Quietly ashamed  
- **Magic:** Aftermath only  
- **Authority:** Feudal, logistical, restrained  
- **Purpose:** Onboarding, grounding, micro-narratives  

Lowmark’s power is not what it does.  
It is what it refuses to become.
