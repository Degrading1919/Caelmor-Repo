Rowan is the **only NPC who knows how to reach the Sunken Church**.

### **Old Sennic Vale**
**Role:** Mire elder and storyteller  
**Location:** Driftwood rise / peat-edge shelter

- More lucid when recalling the past than the present

**Memories:**
- Bells that rang without sound
- Mages who listened more than they spoke
- The church sinking slowly, not collapsing

- Does not identify spells or rituals
- Speaks in stories, not systems

**Gameplay Hooks:**
- Lore through oral memory
- Emotional foreshadowing
- Player learns *where*, not *why*

## DESIGN SUMMARY

- **Tone:** Gentle, heavy, merciful
- **Magic:** Memory endured, not wielded
- **Authority:** Earned through care
- **Anomaly:** Remembered, not interpreted
- **Key Site:** Sunken Church (reachable, not solved)

The Mire does not demand remembrance.  
It carries it — until someone else is ready to listen.
