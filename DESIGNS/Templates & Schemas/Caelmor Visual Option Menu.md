# Caelmor Visual Option Menu (Region / Role / Condition)

## 0) Global Baseline (apply to everything)
- Grounded, practical silhouettes (workwear + travel layers)
- “Quiet decay”: repaired seams, re-used materials, modest ornament
- Avoid spectacle: no glowing runes / VFX / cinematic lighting
- Default human proportions (no canon regional height differences; vary via lean/average/stocky templates, not “race scaling”)

### Universal wear/condition sliders (pick one per asset)
- Fresh-issued / maintained
- Travel-worn (dust + scuffs + minor repairs)
- Work-worn (stains + patchwork + tool abrasion)
- Weather-beaten (frayed hems + sun-bleach + waterlines)
- Hard-survivor (heavy repair history + mismatched replacements)
