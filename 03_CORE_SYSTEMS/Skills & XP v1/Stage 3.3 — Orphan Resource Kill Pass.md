## GATHERING / WORLD INTERACTION SKILLS

### Foraging
- **Foraging → Nutritional → Cooking → Sustained performance & long-form play**
- **Foraging → Stabilizing → Alchemy, Cooking → Failure control & variance smoothing**
- **Foraging → Catalytic → Alchemy → Reaction initiation & transformation**
- **Foraging → Binding → Cooking, Mechanisms → Assembly & containment**

Breaks if scarce:
- Session endurance collapses  
- Alchemy reliability degrades  
- Composite crafting bottlenecks

### Woodcutting
- **Woodcutting → Structural → Fletching, Fabrication → Flexible frameworks**
- **Woodcutting → Binding → Mechanisms, Fabrication → Jointing & cohesion**
- **Woodcutting → Conductive → Fletching, Mechanisms → Elastic energy transfer**
- **Woodcutting → Stabilizing → Mechanisms → Shock absorption & damping**

Breaks if scarce:
- Ranged loops collapse  
- Composite assembly bottlenecks

### Scavenging
- **Scavenging → Structural → Mechanisms, Fabrication → Irregular frameworks**
- **Scavenging → Binding → Fabrication → Reassembly & adaptation**
- **Scavenging → Conductive → Adornment, Mechanisms → Anomalous transfer**
- **Scavenging → Catalytic → Adornment → Legacy & prestige modifiers**

Breaks if scarce:
- Ruins lose progression value  
- Cross-skill items disappear  
- High-tier differentiation collapses

## FINAL CHECK
- No orphan resource roles  
- Every role has multiple meaningful consumers or an intentional high-tier niche  
- Scarcity produces systemic failure, not inconvenience
