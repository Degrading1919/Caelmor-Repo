## GATHERING / WORLD INTERACTION SKILLS

---

## Foraging

### Economic Role
Foraging supplies all living-terrain inputs that cannot be extracted through force or industry.
It is the backbone of subtle power systems and long-term stability.

### What Breaks If It Is Untrained
- Alchemy stagnates at low tiers
- Cooking loses regional depth and endurance paths
- Exploration becomes economically unrewarding

### Resource Roles Supplied
- Nutritional
- Stabilizing
- Catalytic
- Binding

### Downstream Dependencies
- Cooking (nutritional, binding)
- Alchemy (catalytic, stabilizing)
- Mechanisms (binding compounds)

### Regional Identity
- **Thrives:** Lowmark, Mire
- **Struggles:** Emberholt
- **Culturally Supported:** Lowmark (quiet sustenance)
- **Culturally Suppressed:** Emberholt (non-industrial value)

### World Rationale
Lowmark’s restraint during the war preserved its land.
The Mire’s grief altered growth in dangerous but valuable ways.
Foraging reflects listening to the land rather than extracting from it.

## Hunting

### Economic Role
Hunting is the sole source of intact biological structure.
It controls the supply of flexible, resilient, and beast-derived materials.

### What Breaks If It Is Untrained
- Leatherworking collapses
- Fletching loses advanced paths

- Adornment (catalytic modifiers)
- Alchemy (catalytic inputs)

### Regional Identity
- **Thrives:** Thornfell, Mire
- **Struggles:** Emberholt
- **Culturally Supported:** Thornfell (self-sufficiency)
- **Culturally Neutral:** Lowmark

### World Rationale
War reshaped fauna in Thornfell and the Mire.
Hunting there is dangerous, respected, and economically essential.

## Angling

### Economic Role
Angling governs endurance economies and fluid-based systems.
It is the only path to sustained, long-duration support.

### What Breaks If It Is Untrained
- Cooking loses endurance chains

- Long expeditions become unsustainable

### Resource Roles Supplied
- Nutritional
- Stabilizing
- Catalytic
- Conductive (fluid-borne)

### Downstream Dependencies
- Cooking (nutritional, stabilizing)
- Alchemy (catalytic, conductive)

### Regional Identity
- **Thrives:** Lowmark
- **Struggles:** Thornfell, Emberholt
- **Culturally Supported:** Lowmark
- **Culturally Ignored:** Emberholt

### World Rationale
Lowmark’s rivers carried the war’s memory.
Angling is treated as patient endurance, not extraction.

## Mining

### Economic Role
Mining is the backbone of hard progression.
It defines all metallic ceilings in the game.

### What Breaks If It Is Untrained

### Resource Roles Supplied
- Structural
- Conductive
- Catalytic
- Stabilizing

### Downstream Dependencies
- Smithing
- Mechanisms
- Fletching
- Adornment (stabilizing matrices)

### Regional Identity
- **Thrives:** Thornfell, Emberholt
- **Struggles:** Lowmark
- **Culturally Supported:** Thornfell, Emberholt

### World Rationale
Thornfell’s ridges and Emberholt’s volcanic depths absorbed war through stone.
Mining is respected, dangerous, and politically charged.

## Woodcutting

### Economic Role
Woodcutting supplies flexible structure and kinetic conduction.
It enables scale without rigidity.

### What Breaks If It Is Untrained
- Fletching collapses
- Mechanisms lose shock absorption
- Fabrication bottlenecks

### Resource Roles Supplied
- Structural
- Binding
- Conductive (elastic / kinetic)
- Stabilizing

### Downstream Dependencies
- Fletching
- Mechanisms
- Fabrication

### Regional Identity
- **Thrives:** Lowmark, Thornfell
- **Struggles:** Mire
- **Culturally Supported:** Lowmark

### World Rationale
Forests survived where restraint existed.
Woodcutting reflects selective harvest, not clear-cutting.

---

## Scavenging

### Economic Role
Scavenging injects legacy, anomaly, and unpredictability into the economy.
It is the only backward-facing progression input.

### What Breaks If It Is Untrained
- Mechanisms lose purpose
- Adornment loses rare paths
- Ruins and warzones become dead content

### Resource Roles Supplied
- Structural (irregular)
- Binding
- Conductive
- Catalytic

### Downstream Dependencies
- Mechanisms
- Adornment
- Fabrication

### Regional Identity
- **Thrives:** Mire, Emberholt ruins
- **Dangerous:** Everywhere
- **Culturally Feared:** Lowmark
- **Secretly Exploited:** Emberholt

### World Rationale
The war left behind broken systems and forbidden remnants.
Scavenging is risky because history here is unstable.

## CRAFTING / CREATION SKILLS

---

- Stabilizing

### Regional Identity
- **Thrives:** Thornfell, Emberholt
- **Culturally Central:** Thornfell
- **Politically Controlled:** Emberholt

## Leatherworking

### Economic Role
Leatherworking enables mobility, flexibility, and light defense economies.

### What Breaks If It Is Untrained

- Economy fragments into silos

### Resource Roles Required
- Binding
- Structural
- Conductive
