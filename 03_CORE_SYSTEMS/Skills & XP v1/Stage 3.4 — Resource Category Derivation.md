---

### Transmission Media (Energy & Signal Carriers)
- **Primary Role(s):** Conductive  
- **Generated By Skills:** Mining, Woodcutting, Hunting, Scavenging, Angling

- **Primary Output Classes Supported:**  
  - Ranged weapon cores  
  - Situational ammunition types  
  - Adaptive consumables  
  - Behavior-altering modifiers  
  - Automated support structures  
- **Why This Category Exists:**  
  Allows actions, forces, reactions, or effects to propagate instead of dissipating.  
- **Scarcity Impact:**  
  Systems become inert, one-note, or unresponsive.  
- **Tier Pressure:** Mid mastery

---

### Reactants (Reaction Initiators)
- **Primary Role(s):** Catalytic  
- **Generated By Skills:** Foraging, Hunting, Angling, Scavenging  
- **Consumed By Skills:** Alchemy, Cooking, Adornment  
- **Primary Output Classes Supported:**  
  - Adaptive consumables  
  - Preparation-based advantage meals  
  - Specialization-defining attachments  
  - High-risk transformation agents  
- **Why This Category Exists:**  
  Enables change, adaptation, and situational advantage rather than static power.  
- **Scarcity Impact:**  
  Players lose reactive tools and must brute-force challenges.  
- **Tier Pressure:** Mid mastery

---

### Control Agents (Stability Regulators)
- **Primary Role(s):** Stabilizing  
- **Generated By Skills:** Foraging, Mining, Woodcutting, Angling  
- **Consumed By Skills:** Smithing, Cooking, Alchemy, Adornment, Mechanisms, Fabrication  
- **Primary Output Classes Supported:**  
  - Structural combat reinforcements  
  - Sustained endurance meals  
  - Environmental interaction brews  
  - Expedition safety devices  
  - System-bridging assemblies  
- **Why This Category Exists:**  
  Prevents failure cascades as systems scale in complexity and risk.  
- **Scarcity Impact:**  
  High-tier play becomes unreliable and punishing.  
- **Tier Pressure:** Early → High mastery (escalating importance)

---

### Sustenance Sources (Biological Sustenance Inputs)
- **Primary Role(s):** Nutritional  
- **Generated By Skills:** Foraging, Hunting, Angling  
- **Consumed By Skills:** Cooking  
- **Primary Output Classes Supported:**  
  - Sustained endurance meals  
  - Recovery and reset foods  
  - Preparation-based advantage meals  
- **Why This Category Exists:**  
  Supports long-form play, expedition pacing, and non-combat viability.  
- **Scarcity Impact:**  
  Downtime increases and exploration collapses into short loops.  
- **Tier Pressure:** Early mastery (ongoing relevance)

---

## B) CATEGORY REDUNDANCY AUDIT

- All categories support **multiple output classes**.
- Nutritional inputs serve a focused but critical system (Cooking) that directly governs session endurance and non-combat play.
- No category exists for a single low-impact output.

> **No remaining resource categories are orphaned.**

## C) SKILL COVERAGE CHECK

### Gathering Skills
- Foraging → Cohesive Assemblers, Reaction Initiators, Stability Regulators, Biological Sustenance Inputs  
- Hunting → Load-Bearing Frameworks, Cohesive Assemblers, Reaction Initiators, Energy & Signal Carriers  
- Angling → Biological Sustenance Inputs, Reaction Initiators, Energy & Signal Carriers, Stability Regulators  
- Mining → Load-Bearing Frameworks, Energy & Signal Carriers, Stability Regulators  
- Woodcutting → Load-Bearing Frameworks, Cohesive Assemblers, Energy & Signal Carriers, Stability Regulators  
- Scavenging → Load-Bearing Frameworks, Cohesive Assemblers, Energy & Signal Carriers, Reaction Initiators  

✔ All gathering skills generate 2+ meaningful categories.

### Crafting / Processing Skills
- Smithing → Structural, Conductive, Stabilizing  
- Leatherworking → Structural, Binding  
- Fletching → Structural, Binding, Conductive  
- Cooking → Nutritional, Binding, Stabilizing, Catalytic  
- Alchemy → Catalytic, Conductive, Stabilizing  
- Adornment → Catalytic, Conductive, Stabilizing  
- Mechanisms → Structural, Binding, Conductive, Stabilizing  
- Fabrication → Structural, Binding, Conductive, Stabilizing  

✔ All crafting skills consume 2+ categories.  
✔ Fabrication consumes categories but generates none.  
✔ No category is generated and consumed by the same skill exclusively.

**Edge Case:**  
- Nutritional inputs are only consumed by Cooking, but Cooking feeds endurance, recovery, and preparation loops that affect *all* playstyles.

## D) FORWARD COMPATIBILITY NOTES

- **Energy & Signal Carriers** and **Reaction Initiators** are most likely to gain additional uses in future regions due to their adaptability.  
- **Biological Sustenance Inputs** are intentionally constrained to prevent inventory bloat and power creep.  
- **Stability Regulators** are capped in scope to preserve tension at high mastery rather than eliminate risk.
