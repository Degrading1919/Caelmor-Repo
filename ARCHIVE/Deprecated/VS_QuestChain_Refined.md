# VS Quest Chain — “Learning the Land”  
## Refined Version (Narrative Editor & Style Guardian)

### Region: Lowmark Vale  
### Quest Count: 4 (Micro-Arc)

This vertical slice chain introduces the core early-game systems: movement, basic combat, gathering, crafting, and traversal. The tone is grounded, quiet, and practical—reflecting Lowmark’s weathered landscape and cautious culture.

---

# Quest 1 — “The Ridge and the Road”  
**POI:** Overlook Ridge  
**Purpose:** Introduce movement and agility triggers.

### Narrative Summary  
A local watcher—placeholder name **Rella, Ridge-Watch**—asks you to confirm whether the descent into the Vale is still safe after recent storms. The request is simple and observational, fitting Lowmark’s practical tone.

### Objectives  
1. Walk to the **ridge descent point** and use the step-down agility interaction.  
2. Reach **Creek Crossing** safely.  
3. Inspect the broken bridge plank.

### Completion  
Return to Rella (or auto-complete if the VS excludes NPC interaction).

### Rewards  
- Small Movement XP (framed as “world familiarity”)  
- **1× Dried Banner-Thistle** (minor healing flavor item)

---

# Quest 2 — “First Signs of Trouble”  
**POI:** Creek Crossing  
**Purpose:** Teach first combat encounter with a single Tier 1 enemy.

### Narrative Summary  
Examining the broken plank reveals light tracks leading toward the right bank. Rella’s earlier warning proves true—goblins sometimes test the crossing.

### Objectives  
1. Follow the tracks along the creek’s right bank.  
2. Defeat **1× Field Goblin**.  
3. Collect the recovered scrap (auto-loot or manual pickup).

### Completion  
You’re directed to continue assessing the path toward the abandoned farmstead.

### Rewards  
- **1× Goblin Scrap** (quest item used next step)  
- Light XP in **Melee** or **Ranged**, depending on weapon used

---

# Quest 3 — “Tools of the Trade”  
**POI:** Ruined Farmstead  
**Purpose:** Introduce gathering and crafting in a simple, closed loop.

### Narrative Summary  
The goblin scrap alone is worthless, but the ruined farmstead ahead still holds shallow iron seams. Rella suggests forging something basic before moving deeper into the Vale—Lowmark pragmatism in practice.

### Objectives  
1. Mine from the **Iron T1 Ore Node** near the collapsed chimney (1–2 ore).  
2. Use the **campfire/forge placeholder** to craft:  
   - **1× Iron Bar**  
   - Then either **1× Simple Blade** or **1× Iron Knife**  
3. Equip the crafted item.

### Notes  
Crafting follows minimal VS recipes consistent with Phase 1.3 and 1.4 loops.

### Rewards  
- The crafted tool/weapon  
- XP in **Smithing** and **Mining**

---

# Quest 4 — “Through the Fields”  
**POI:** Field Edges → Old Boundary Wall  
**Purpose:** Teach wildlife behavior, safe traversal, and a final mixed-role encounter.

### Narrative Summary  
Rella’s final request is to confirm whether the old boundary road is still passable. Wildlife roams the fields, and remnants of the Long War linger near the wall.

### Objectives  
1. Reach the **Field Edges**.  
2. *Optional:* Hunt **1× Furrow Boar** to introduce Hunting without forcing combat.  
3. Continue to the **Old Boundary Wall**.  
4. Defeat the mixed encounter:  
   - **1× Lost Footman (Tier 2)**  
   - **1× Goblin Lookout (Tier 2)**  
5. Inspect the disturbed campfire ashes.

### Completion  
A final acknowledgment from Rella (or a simple completion message) confirms the path is usable again.

### Rewards  
- Small XP across relevant skills (Melee/Ranged, Hunting if the boar is taken)  
- **1× Cookable Meat** (if boar hunted)  
- **1× Field-Checked Token** (flavor item signifying completion)
