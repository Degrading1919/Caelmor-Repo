## Chain Name: “Learning the Land”

---

# Quest 1 — “The Ridge and the Road”
**POI:** Overlook Ridge  
**Purpose:** Teach movement + agility triggers

### Narrative Summary
A local hand (NPC placeholder: “Rella, Ridge-Watch”) asks you to test whether the path down into the Vale is still passable after recent storms.

### Objectives
1. Walk to the **ridge’s descent point** and trigger the step-down agility interaction.  
2. Reach the **Creek Crossing** safely.  
3. Inspect the broken bridge plank.

### Completion
Return to Rella (or auto-complete if no NPC is in VS).

### Rewards
- Small XP in Movement (no skill, just world familiarity flavor)
- 1× Dried Banner-Thistle (minor heal flavor item)

---

# Quest 2 — “First Signs of Trouble”
**POI:** Creek Crossing  
**Purpose:** Teach basic combat with a single Tier 1 enemy.

### Narrative Summary
While inspecting the ruined plank, you notice tracks leading toward the creek’s right bank. Rella warns: goblins sometimes test the crossing.

### Objectives
1. Follow the tracks (simple waypoint or geographic cue: right-bank route).  
2. Defeat **1× Field Goblin**.  
3. Loot any usable scrap (auto-loot or pickup).

### Completion
The player is told to continue assessing the path toward the farmstead.

### Rewards
- 1× Goblin Scrap (quest item, used next step)
- Light XP: Melee or Ranged

---

# Quest 3 — “Tools of the Trade”
**POI:** Ruined Farmstead  
**Purpose:** Teach gathering + crafting loop (ore → bar → tool/weapon)

### Narrative Summary
Rella notes the goblin scrap is worthless by itself but the ruined farmstead ahead hides ore deposits. She suggests forging something simple before moving deeper.

### Objectives
1. Mine from the **Iron T1 Ore Node** near the chimney (1–2 ore).  
2. Use the **campfire/forge placeholder** to craft either:
   - 1× Iron Bar  
   - Then **1× Simple Blade** _or_ **1× Iron Knife** (flavor: training tool)  
3. Equip the item.

### Notes
Crafting uses minimal VS recipes, aligned with Phase 1.3 & 1.4 crafting loops.

### Rewards
- 1× Simple Blade / Iron Knife
- Smithing XP + Mining XP

---

# Quest 4 — “Through the Fields”
**POI:** Field Edges → Boundary Wall  
**Purpose:** Teach wildlife behavior + traversal + final mixed-role fight

### Narrative Summary
To confirm the old boundary road is still usable, Rella asks you to check whether the wall section is occupied. Wildlife may be present along the way.

### Objectives
1. Reach the **Field Edges**.  
2. Optional: Hunt **1× Furrow Boar** (introduces Hunting without forcing combat).  
3. Continue to the **Old Boundary Wall**.  
4. Defeat the mixed-role encounter:
   - **1× Lost Footman (Tier 2)**
   - **1× Goblin Lookout (Tier 2)**  
5. Inspect the disturbed campfire ashes.

### Completion
Player returns or receives final message: Rella acknowledges the path is usable again.

### Rewards
- Small XP across relevant skills (Melee/Ranged/Hunting)  
- 1× Cookable Meat (if boar hunted)  
- 1× “Field-Checked Token” (flavor completion item)
