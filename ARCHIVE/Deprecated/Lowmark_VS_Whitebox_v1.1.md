# Lowmark_VS_Whitebox_v1.1
### Vertical Slice Zone — Unified Whitebox, Encounters, Pacing & Ambient Storytelling  
### Region: Lowmark Vale (v1 Primary Region)

---

# 1. Zone Overview

**Zone Type:** Early-game testing zone for movement, combat, gathering, and ambient storytelling.  
**Length:** ~180m traversal (150–250m whitebox range).  
**Camera:** Top-down MMORPG (limited object-level detail; emphasis on silhouette clarity).  
**Biome:** Shallow creek, overgrown farmstead, field margins, broken stone boundary wall.

**Design Intent:**  
- Teach core movement (walk → agility triggers).  
- Introduce fair, readable, low-complexity encounters.  
- Provide a starter resource loop (woodcutting, herbs, ore, hunting).  
- Establish Lowmark’s “weathered, recovering land” identity through visible, top-down ambient storytelling.

# 2. Zone Layout & Traversal

The zone forms a gentle **S-curve** from north to south, transitioning through five major spaces:

| POI | Description | Traversal Role |
|-----|-------------|----------------|
| **A. Overlook Ridge** | Elevated start, clean silhouettes, landscape overview | Orientation space |
| **B. Creek Crossing** | Shallow water, broken bridge, forked routing | Early routing choice |
| **C. Ruined Farmstead** | First structured combat pocket | Controlled combat space |
| **D. Field Edges** | Open hunting loop | Decompression & gathering |
| **E. Old Boundary Wall** | Mixed-role encounter & mining seam | Capstone fight |

### Traversal Paths
- **P1:** Ridge → Creek (down-slope, agility-trigger drop)  
- **P2:** Creek → Farmstead (bridge route or creekbank route)  
- **P3:** Farmstead → Field Edges (through broken fencing)  
- **P4:** Field Edges → Boundary Wall (gentle elevation rise)

### Top-Down Considerations
- Landmarks emphasize **shape language**: angular barn silhouette, S-shaped creek, straight-line boundary wall.  
- Environmental storytelling relies on **patterning**, not micro-detail—burn scars, broken fence lines, discolored soil patches.

---

# 3. Points of Interest (POIs)

## **A. Overlook Ridge — Spawn & Orientation**
- Elevated, readable silhouette.  
- 1–2 T1 tree nodes.  
- Clear visibility of creek and farmstead from above.  
- Serves as a safe intro zone with no hostile aggro.

---

## **B. Creek Crossing — Traversal Demonstration**
- Shallow water plane with subtle value contrast for readability.  
- Broken plank bridge acting as a visual route cue.  
- Two traversal choices: direct bridge path (combat) or left creekbank (wildlife).  
- Woodcutting and herb nodes placed along the banks.

---

## **C. Ruined Farmstead — Primary Encounter Pocket**
- Barn silhouette: 3–4 large primitive shapes; roof collapsed in a clean diagonal for top-down readability.  
- Partial fencing forms natural funnels into controlled combat start.  
- T1 ore node by collapsed chimney remains clearly readable from overhead.

---

## **D. Field Edges — Wildlife Loop**
- Open grass plane with soft boundaries (tree line and fence remnants).  
- Ideal space for hunting and low-pressure XP loops.  
- Herb and woodcutting nodes spaced to avoid resource corridors.

---

## **E. Old Boundary Wall — Secondary Encounter Pocket**
- 8–12m cracked wall segment forming an obvious landmark.  
- Slight height step for silhouette contrast.  
- Campfire mock + mining seam for crafting and survival introduction.

---

# 4. Encounter Design (Difficulty, Roles, Placement)

These encounters follow Caelmor’s philosophy of **readable, predictable, low-cognitive-load combat**, appropriate for an early MMO zone.

### Difficulty Tier Summary
- **Tier 0 (Passive):** Wildlife; no aggression unless provoked.  
- **Tier 1 (Basic Hostiles):** Goblins, Hounds; simple attack cadences.  
- **Tier 2 (Moderate Hostiles):** Mixed-role pairs; slow heavies + simple ranged.

---

## **A. Overlook Ridge**
**Enemies:** None  
**Purpose:** Ensure onboarding without risk or aggro sniping from below.

---

## **B. Creek Crossing**
### **Direct Bridge Path**
- **1× Field Goblin (Tier 1)**  
  - Attack: simple poke every 2.8s.  
  - Placement: right side of bridge; clear aggro radius visualization.

### **Creekbank Route**
- **1× Furrow Boar (Tier 0)**  
- **5% chance: 1× Ash Hound (Tier 1)**  
- Very safe wildlife introduction.

---

## **C. Ruined Farmstead (Primary Combat Zone)**
- **2× Field Goblins (Tier 1)** spaced 8–12m apart → avoids double-pulls.  
- **1× Ash Hound (Tier 1)** patrolling a clean, circular 12–15m path.  
- All enemies have **simple 1–2 attack behaviors**, no pattern analysis required.

**Purpose:** First “real” fight that feels fair, controlled, and readable.

---

## **D. Field Edges (Wildlife Loop)**
- **1–2× Furrow Boars (Tier 0)**  
- **Optional rare Ash Hound (Tier 1)**  
- Players can approach from many angles; excellent for gathering + hunting loops.

---

## **E. Old Boundary Wall (Capstone Encounter)**
- **1× Lost Footman (Tier 2)**  
  - Slow, tanky melee; heavy swing every 3.5s.  
  - Positioned to block narrow entry.

- **1× Goblin Lookout (Tier 2)**  
  - Simple ranged rock toss every 3.0s.  
  - Elevated stone piece grants clear LOS advantages.

Purpose: Introduces mixed roles without complexity; a fair zone finale.

# 5. Combat Pacing (Zone-Wide Flow)

### **Phase 1 — Overlook Ridge (0–60m)**  
- No combat; let players orient and establish zone tone.

### **Phase 2 — Creek Crossing (60–120m)**  
- Optional combat; teaches player agency (choose path).

### **Phase 3 — Farmstead (120–150m)**  
- First structured multi-enemy space.  
- TTK target: 6–10 seconds per enemy at early skill levels.

### **Phase 4 — Field Edges (150–200m)**  
- Breathing zone; low-pressure hunting and gathering.

### **Phase 5 — Boundary Wall (200–240m)**  
- Final combat spike; mixed-role duo.

**Overall pacing:**  
Calm → Optional → Controlled → Calm → Capstone.

# 6. Resource Distribution

| Skill | Node Type | Count | Location |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Woodcutting | T1 Logs | 4 | Ridge, Creek, Field Edges |
| Mining | Iron T1 | 2 | Farmstead, Boundary Wall |
| Herbs | Banner-Thistle / Reeds | 2–3 | Creek, Field Edges |
| Hunting | Wildlife | 3–4 | Field Edges, Farmstead |
| Leatherworking | Carcass sources | 1–2 | Farmstead, Field Edges |

**Design Rules:**
- Nodes are 25–40m apart to prevent farming corridors.  
- Each traversal path should contain 1–2 nodes naturally.  
- All nodes clearly readable from overhead.

---

# 7. Ambient Storytelling (Top-Down MMO Adaptation)

Ambient storytelling is expressed through **shape, clustering, and terrain contrast**, not small props.

---

## **A. Overlook Ridge — “The First Memory”**
- A **curved ridge line** resembling the arc of a shield wall when viewed from above.  
- A **single snapped tree stump** creates an asymmetrical silhouette hinting at past conflict.  
- Bare soil patches arranged in diagonal streaks imply old supply routes.

---

## **B. Creek Crossing — “What the Water Keeps”**
- The **bridge ruin** breaks cleanly into two large visual masses, readable even when zoomed out.  
- Silt discoloration in the creek forms a trail-like band, visually guiding players toward the bank path.  
- Scorch marks appear as large, soft-edged dark shapes—evidence of burned barricades.

---

## **C. Ruined Farmstead — “The Pause in a Life”**
- The barn’s roof collapse forms a **distinct triangular void**, an instantly readable landmark.  
- Fencing forms a broken perimeter that shapes the combat funnel; deliberate gaps tell a story of hurried flight.  
- Farmland furrows remain visible as long parallel lines—storytelling through pattern, not detail.

---

## **D. Field Edges — “What Grows After”**
- Grass height variation creates wide patches indicating regrowth zones.  
- Wildlife trails appear as faint, curved paths—boar activity patterns readable from above.  
- Banner-thistle clusters arranged near fence remnants symbolize recovery.

---

## **E. Old Boundary Wall — “Lines Drawn, Lines Lost”**
- The wall’s cracked section forms a jagged silhouette contrasting with flat terrain.  
- A single collapsed segment lies at an inward angle, implying intentional destruction.  
- Ash coloration spreads outward from the campsite in a circular gradient—recent occupation implied with just color.

---

# 8. Integration Notes (All Teams)

### **For Quest Designers**
- Farmstead and Wall POIs provide natural investigation beats.  
- Creekbank route can host micro-quest breadcrumbs (lost pack, misplaced tool, water-carved marking).  
- Ridge and Wall motifs support Lowmark’s “memory in the land” identity.

### **For Level Designers**
- Maintain clean silhouettes and readable shapes for the top-down camera.  
- Reinforce directional flow using terrain contrast and prop clusters.

### **For Combat Designers**
- Maintain wide pull zones; avoid blind aggro.  
- No more than **two hostiles in view** with overlapping ranges in early gameplay.

### **For Environment Art (Future)**
- Use large-shape storytelling: burn scars, collapsed roof planes, broken wall geometry.  
- Avoid micro clutter that cannot be read from altitude.
