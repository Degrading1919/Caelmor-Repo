1. ITEM SCHEMA — APPROVED WITH ADJUSTMENTS
✔ Approved Fields (mandatory for v1)

From Systems Architect review:

itemId

displayName

category

subType

isStackable

maxStack

value

metadata

These fields are required by v1 inventory, save, and networking rules (Phase 1.4).
✔ Approval rationale: v1 uses slot-based inventory and server-authoritative item handling. These fields enable deterministic serialization and low-friction inventory loops (Deep Research).

⚠ Adjustment

Reject durability for v1.

Durability introduces friction, violates Phase 1.1 “slow but rewarding, not tedious,” and is not needed for core loops.

If desired later, add in v1.5 equipment expansion.

FINAL ITEM SCHEMA DECISION:

✔ Accept all proposed fields,
✖ Reject durability for v1.

2. ENEMY VARIANT SCHEMA — FULL APPROVAL
✔ Approved Fields

variantId

familyId

hp

armor

movementSpeed

attackSpeed

attackDamage

aggroRange

leashRange

xpValue

isBoss

✔ Rationale

All required by:

Tick-based combat (Phase 1.4)

Enemy behavior readability (Pillar B)

XP economy and v1 skill progression (Phase 1.3)

FINAL ENEMY VARIANT DECISION:

✔ Accepted with no modifications.

3. RESOURCE NODE SCHEMA — FULL APPROVAL
✔ Approved Fields

nodeId

resourceType

yieldMin

yieldMax

respawnTimeSeconds

skillRequirement

✔ Rationale

These fields directly support:

WorldSave.json restoration, mandatory in Phase 1.4

Core v1 loops (mining → smithing, woodcutting → fletching, hunting → leatherworking/cooking)

Node lifecycle events needed for multiplayer sync

FINAL RESOURCE NODE DECISION:

✔ Approved without adjustment.

4. CRAFTING RECIPE SCHEMA — APPROVED WITH MINOR ADJUSTMENT
✔ Approved Fields

recipeId

stationType

ingredients[]

results[]

timeToCraft

skillId

minSkill

⚠ Adjustment

Add:

xpGain (optional but recommended)

✔ Rationale

XP is core to v1 progression (Phase 1.3). While XP may be assigned in code or separate tables, including per-recipe XP in schema:

Simplifies tuning

Improves content pipeline clarity

Reduces hidden info (Pillar A: clarity, no grind walls)

FINAL CRAFTING RECIPE DECISION:

✔ Approve all fields
➕ Add xpGain

5. SKILL SCHEMA — APPROVED WITH CRITICAL FIX
✔ Approved Additions

maxLevel

xpCurve[]

✔ Rationale

Phase 1.3 progression system + Phase 1.4 Save schema mandates skill XP persistence.
Without an XP curve, designers would hardcode values, violating the data-driven requirement (Tech Foundation).

⚠ Adjustment

Mandate:

skillCategory (combat, gathering, crafting)

description (minimal, for UI)

These are UX/non-critical but streamline future expansion.

FINAL SKILL SCHEMA DECISION:

✔ Approve required fields
➕ Add skillCategory, description

6. ZONE SCHEMA — APPROVED WITH EXPANSION
✔ Approved Fields

zoneId

displayName

isStartingZone

spawnSets[]

resourceNodes[]

✔ Rationale

Zone definitions must drive:

Host-server world boot (Phase 1.4 runtime pipeline)

Zone-based enemy density control (Pillar C: “meaningful emptiness”)

Resource distribution (Crafting loops)

✔ Additional Required Fields (Game Director adjustment)

Add:

ambientTier (low, mid, high — defines environmental intensity & audio mix)

recommendedLevel (soft guideline for player flow)

These do not change systems; they improve design clarity and vertical slice planning.

FINAL ZONE SCHEMA DECISION:

✔ Approve
➕ Add ambientTier, recommendedLevel

7. QUEST SCHEMA — APPROVED WITH NO RESTRICTIONS
✔ Approved Fields

questId

title

prerequisites[]

repeatable

objectives[]

rewards[]

✔ Rationale

Quest design in Caelmor emphasizes:

Purposeful quests (Tenet #16, Phase 1.2)

Teaching loops (Phase 1.3 skill onboarding)

Narrative integration without filler

The schema fully supports this.

FINAL QUEST SCHEMA DECISION:

✔ Fully approved.

8. NPC SCHEMA — APPROVED WITH MINOR ADJUSTMENT
✔ Approved Fields

npcId

displayName

interactionType

trainerSkillId

dialogueId

✔ Rationale

Matches Phase 1.4 NPC-state sync and v1 skill training.

⚠ Adjustment

Add optional:

vendorInventoryId (for later vendor integration)

factionId (light tag for region or cultural affiliation)

These do not add mechanics; they allow cleaner v1.5 expansion.

FINAL NPC SCHEMA DECISION:

✔ Approve
➕ Add vendorInventoryId, factionId (optional v1.5 fields, v1-compatible)

✅ SUMMARY — FINAL ACCEPTED SCHEMA CHANGES (v1)
Schema	Approved	Adjustments Required
Item	Yes	Remove durability
Enemy Variant	Yes	None
Resource Node	Yes	None
Crafting Recipe	Yes	Add xpGain
Skill	Yes	Add skillCategory, description
Zone	Yes	Add ambientTier, recommendedLevel
Quest	Yes	None
NPC	Yes	Add vendorInventoryId, factionId

All approved fields are non-breaking, additive, and compliant with:

v1 Technical Foundation (Phase 1.4)

Design Pillars (Phase 1.2)

Project Protocol requirements (clean, scalable schemas)
